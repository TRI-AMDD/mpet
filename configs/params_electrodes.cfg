[Particles]
# Type of solid particles
# Options:
# - ACR -- "Allen-Cahn-Reaction" particles. Use ONLY with shape = C3.
# - CHR -- "Cahn-Hilliard-Reaction". Currently req. shape = sphere or cylinder.
# - CHR2 -- 2-concentration field "Cahn-Hilliard-Reaction". Currently req. shape = sphere or cylinder.
# - homog -- homogeneously filling particles
# - homog_sdn -- homogeneously filling particles with size-dependent
# - homog2 -- 2-concentration field model like CHR2 but each layer is
#   treated as homogeneous rather than having transport within each
#   layer
# - diffn -- Particles with rxn at surface and internal solid diffusion
#   WARNING: Using diffn model with BV reaction model assumes surface
#   activity is given by c/(1-c), c = filling fraction, when
#   calculating the reaction rate exchange current density. Consider,
#   e.g., BV_mod01 instead.

# Discretization of solid, m
# Used for non-homogeneous type
# When using phase separating particles, must be less than characteristic interface width, lambda_b:
# lambda_b = (kappa/(rho_s*Omega_a))^(0.5)) [Bazant 2013]
discretization = 1e-9
# Options: sphere, C3, cylinder
#   sphere -- react on all surface area
#   C3 -- react on b surface
#   cylinder -- react on surfaces with radial normal
shape = C3
# C3 a-axis length or cylinder particle thickness, m

[Material]
# muRfunc defines the chemical potential of the reduced state
# (the electron conducting phase, usually solid) as a function of
# filling fraction.
# Options: See props_am.py file, to which new functions can easily be added
muRfunc = LiMn2O4_ss
# Log pad (option for muRfunc's containing log terms -- not solid solution)
# Consider turning this on if you experience errors with log(negative)
# It extends the ideal solution into regions outside (0, 1) by a
# (very steep) linear extension instead of a singularity.
# Options: true, false
# default: false
logPad = false
# Noise -- add Langevin noise to the solid dynamics to simulate some
# random thermal fluctuations. This can help to, e.g., trigger a
# spinodal decomposition but slows simulations so should not be
# enabled unless needed.
# Options: true, false
# default: false
