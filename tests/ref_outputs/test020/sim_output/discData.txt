Particle output files are indexed such that Vol 0 is closest to the
anode current collector for both electrodes.  Indexing within volumes
is such that Part 0 is closest to the "carbon backbone" if simPartCond
was set to true for that electrode. Otherwise it is in arbitrary
order.


Particle discretization info follows.  Lengths and number of
discretization points are provided for each simulated particle.
Meshes are made as a linear space between zero and particle length
with the given number of points.  Rows correspond to different
simulation volumes with the first row being closest to the anode
current collector and the last closest to the cathode current
collector.  Columns represent individual particles within each
simulated volume in no particular order.
